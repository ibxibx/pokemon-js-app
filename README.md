Pokédex JavaScript App
Project Description

Welcome to the Pokédex JavaScript web application! This project showcases my skills in building a dynamic web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The app uses the Pokémon API to fetch and display information in form of a list of Pokémon Characters and show details for each.

How to Get the Project Running:
To run the project locally and see it in action:
- Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Project Dependencies:
- JavaScript Version: ES6
- CSS Styling: Custom styles with Bootstrap for layout and basic design.
- ESLint Rules: JavaScript code is formatted according to ESLint rules to maintain code quality and consistency.

API Used:
- The project utilizes the Pokémon API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/) to dynamically fetch Pokémon data. 
- This API provides comprehensive information about Pokémon species title, height and picture, which is seamlessly integrated into the application.

Technical Details Covered:
- Dynamic Data Loading: Fetches data asynchronously from an external API using JavaScript's fetch API.
- Responsive Design: Utilizes CSS and Bootstrap for responsive layout and styling, ensuring compatibility across different devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile phone).
- Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for API requests to provide a smooth user experience.
- Accessibility: Ensures accessibility standards are met to accommodate users with disabilities.

Deployment: The app is deployable to GitHub Pages or any other static hosting service for public access and demonstration.

Future enhancements could include: 
- Adding more details to each Pokemon Profile from the API.
- Adding to the menue the following features:
- Rating the pokemons and compiling a list of favourites.
- Downloading beautifully formatted pokemon cards as JPEG pictures.
- Search Functionality: Implementing a search feature to allow users to search for a specific Pokémon.
- Pagination: Enhancing the user experience by implementing pagination for navigating through a large dataset of Pokémons.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development technologies and my ability to integrate external APIs to build functional and visually appealing web applications.
